## gomeasure
gomeasure is a CLI tool that measures the lines of code and the count of files in a directory or project

<!--TODO : Create a table for all commands -->
## Usage
```
gomeasure --help
```

## DISCLAIMER:
Normally, the program reads all kinds of file and returns the number of lines in each of them. Therefore, it is up to the developer to filter out the files to be scanned with 
flags `-i` and `-I`.
