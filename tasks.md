### basic tasks 

- modify the runner.go to receive the arguments that we pass from the CLI tool (constructors)
- we have to modify runner.go to count files only instead of reading the files and returning the number of lines
- add some flags to specify only some type of files (-f dart) or exclude
- write tests

### possible flags:

- specifying file types (include, exclude) (--include, -i) (--no-include, -I)
- don't count empty lines (empty)

### future flags:

- count comments (//, /* ,///)
